My primary focus is on building a strong, reusable structure that prioritizes quality over speed something that was challenging in previous companies due to strict and often unrealistic time constraints. Ultimately, my goal is to create a foundational app with essential features for common applications, continuously updating it with the latest industry advancements to support faster, higher-quality development in the future.<br>I'm looking to collaborate on futuristic apps which has something to do with AI<br>I'm looking for help with learning advanced implementation of jetpack compose and finding what's the next big thing is.<br>I'm currently learning Jetpack compose<br>Ask me about native Android and its benefits <br>Fun fact - We are always learning new things
